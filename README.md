# Tic-tac-toe
This Java TicTacToe program was developed for a programming assignment in my 2nd semester as a CS undergrad 
at Mittweida University of Applied Sciences. It utilizes the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm and optimizes it using [alpha-beta-pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
to simulate an unbeatable oponent on 3x3 and 4x4 boards. 

## Implementation details
The implementation is explained in more detail in <b>TicTacToeAusarbeitung.pdf</b> (German). 

## Running the game
If you'd like to have a go at the game feel free to download and run <b>TicTacToeSpiel.jar</b>. You'll need to download and install [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) if you don't have it already on your system.
